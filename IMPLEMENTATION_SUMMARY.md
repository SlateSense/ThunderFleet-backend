# Enhanced Logging System - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
The original logging system was not capturing comprehensive player data as requested. The logs were empty or incomplete, making it impossible to track:
- Payment sent/received status
- Bet amounts and payout details
- Game timestamps and duration
- Disconnect/reconnect events during games
- Win/loss results
- Game performance statistics

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Comprehensive Player Session Tracking**
- Added `playerSessions` object to `SeaBattleGame` class
- Tracks complete player lifecycle from join to game end
- Real-time updates throughout the game

### 2. **Enhanced Log Structure**
- **Player Sessions Logger**: `logs/player-sessions-YYYY-MM-DD.log`
- **Transaction Logger**: `logs/transactions-YYYY-MM-DD.log`
- **Game Logger**: `logs/games-YYYY-MM-DD.log`
- **Player Logger**: `logs/players-YYYY-MM-DD.log`
- **Error Logger**: `logs/errors-YYYY-MM-DD.log`
